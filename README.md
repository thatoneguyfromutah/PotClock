Work the Green, Clean, and Serene Twelve Step recovery program with help from PotClock!

PotClock 2 is a limit tracking application for working the Green, Clean, and Serene Twelve Step recovery program. This digital tool builds upon the idea of the program to help folks track their limits. It is intended to only be used for working the program. More information can be found in the guide section of the app.

Built with Xcode Version 14.2 (14C18), no guarentees it works on the latest version, I am on a MacBook Pro that no longer gets software updates as of the time of writing this.

Use this code for inspiration, but do not simply copy and paste per se, plagiarism is not cool. I plan to update this GitHub every time I ship an update to PotClock for others to see. If you want to support the developer (that is me) and future development efforts on this app there is a tipping section on the Twitter by X page and in the app on the App Store.
